# Power-Grid-Optimization-and-Visualization-Tool
The project tackles the challenge of modeling and analyzing electrical grids under changing conditions such as distance, load demand, and component failure, by providing an interactive Python dashboard. This Tool visualizes routes, network backbones, flow capacities, and critical failure points in real time.
